# News Data Analysis Project

This repository contains the code and analysis for exploring and analyzing news datasets. The project focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), text analysis, time series analysis, and publisher insights.
Project Overview

## 1. Repository Setup

    Created a GitHub repository with a dedicated branch: feature/task-1.
    Committed progress at least three times a day with descriptive messages.

## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

    Descriptive Statistics:
        Analyzed headline lengths to understand textual data distribution.
        Identified the most active publishers and their contributions.
        Studied publication dates to observe trends over time.

## 3. Text Analysis

    Sentiment Analysis: Classified headlines as Positive, Negative, or Neutral.
    Topic Modeling: Identified common keywords and significant topics like "FDA approval" and "price target".

## 4. Time Series Analysis

    Analyzed publication frequency trends and identified spikes in news activity.
    Studied publishing times to discover peak hours of news releases.

## 5. Publisher Analysis

    Identified top publishers and analyzed their focus areas.
    Extracted unique email domains (if available) to group contributors.
